## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use to use the transfrom property and others properties to get the desired design


```css
.share-options {
    background-color: var(--Very-Dark-Grayish-Blue);
    color: white;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: calc(100% + 28px);
    left: 50%;
    transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, -100, 0);
    display: flex;
    gap: 15px;
    padding: 20px 30px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    transform-origin: bottom;
    transition: all 0.5s ease;
    visibility: hidden;
}

.share-options.active {
    visibility: visible;
}

.share-options::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 100%;
    left: 46%;
    margin-left: -5px;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: hsl(217, 19%, 35%) transparent transparent transparent;
}
```
